# Basic-Sentiment-Analysis with Python
#### Note1: Don't expect complicated and tremendous strategies to achieve opinion mining, this is only a practical instance of using some basic rules to elicit the polarity of an input text.
#### Note2: I focus on detecting the overall polarity (Document Level Sentiment Classification) instead of Aspect level Sentiment Classification.
#### Note3: For detecting the polarity of the sentences, a dictionary has been used. A dictionary is no more than a list of words that share a category.

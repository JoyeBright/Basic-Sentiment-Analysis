       " it was also a wonderful introduction to preparing food for our 3 year old daughter." \
       " Ever since her Grandpa bought this for her, she's made everything from a cheese sandwhich to a triple decker salami club!" \
       " She had so much fun playing with this toy, that she started to become interested in how I prepared meals." \
       " She now is very eager to spread peanut butter and jam, layer turkey and cheese and help mix cake batter." \
       " Set comes with cute red basket and 13 pieces of sandwich. A very cute gift to give a girl or boy."
text = "his toy does not look like the picture at all. The bread, tomato, and lettuce were all hard." \
       " The only parts that are a bit realistic are the cheese and meats." \
       " This toy came with only one tomato and one lettuce." \
       " That's not enough objects to make multiple full sandwiches." \
       " I would recommend not buying this toy if you want your money's worth."
